Aran Suddi 07/03/22 1 Comment There comes a point in many games where everything just clicks. The gameplay’s strengths shine, the story enthrals, the multiplayer or loot system gets you hooked, and you just can’t wait to get back to it when you’re away from it. Babylon’s Fall is not one of those games. Instead, Platinum Games’ latest is a surprisingly dull affair, with repetitive gameplay, a bland story, and multiplayer where things are just too easy to provide any real challenge. Here’s our Babylon’s Fall review. Babylon’s Fall is a live service game, meaning it comes with a push to get players to engage with the marketplace and a battle pass to get better gear. It’s far from the first game to do this, and it’s not even the first Square Enix published game to do it, but it seems lessons have not really been learned from other examples of live service games. After every mission Babylon’s Fall throws loot at you, and often that free loot is more than enough to survive on. This is actually great for players who do not want to spend any extra money on Babylon’s Fall, but means that character progression is amped up so that you don’t need to engage as deeply with some systems in the game.

Even after clearing two cloisters you still cannot do the most basic of things in the game, which is visiting the blacksmith to enhance your weapons or get rid of gear you just do not need. It is such an odd decision to keep a fundamental feature of gear upgrading locked away for so long, and means you will keep changing your build as you unlock higher tier weapons instead of being able to enhance a weapon you may be fond of and developing a build that you want early on. The hub world does not really provide much outside of being the place you go back to start a new quest, or to redeem rewards for completing the in-game achievements. Before you start a new quest, Babylon’s Fall will begin matchmaking to find other players to join with. You can start the quests alone, but if you want to make quick progress you may as well wait for the party to fill up, unless no one is available and you are forced to start by yourself. Unlike a number of games where enemies scale as the number of players increase, Babylon’s Fall doesn’t seem to do this. If you go solo it will take you time to get through the enemy encounters and provide a real challenge. However, if you a have a team of four you will be cutting through mobs and bosses with ease, as if you were a hot knife going through butter. After each encounter you are awarded a medal from stone to pure platinum, in classic Platinum action game style, but you have to be actively trying to fail as a team in order to not getting pure platinum, where time taken to complete a mission seems to matter the most.

It shoots for a painterly art style, but it instead feels as though you’re playing something from two generations ago when looking at the character models and environments. When you are in underwater areas it looks like someone has smeared something across your screen, while story scenes are portrayed in sketches and even these do not look good. I do not know why this artistic take was chosen, but for some reason it was. In battle there is so much going on at times you cannot actually work out what is really happening, or the camera might suddenly end up behind a piece of the environment. Mobs are slow to react to attacking you making them pretty easy to pick off, and with most bosses you can just stay back and hit them from range using your powerful attacks to deal damage. Oh, and every dungeon follows the same basic pattern on going through three or four mob battles before fighting some kind of boss. The most engaging part of the game is experimenting with different weapons early on, with some having different effects like enhancing attacks or providing healing when being used. The armour does similar but it all looks a bit ugly, so it’s best to use a skin that hides what the armour looks like. On top of that the music is forgettable and the story is just really dull. I do not know how you make a story about exploring a magical tower in Old Babylon and dealing with a supernatural army boring, but Babylon’s Fall manages it. Summary Babylon's Fall is just dull, repetitive and ultimately forgettable. The combat at the game's core so simple and lacking in challenge, especially if you have a full team. We all know that PlatinumGames are capable of games so much more than this, and Square Enix should probably step back from their live service efforts, because they simply haven't cracked it. Good There's a demo to try Babylon’s Fall may teach you the value of money, and what not to waste it on You will come to appreciate the power of ranged attacks Matchmaking works Bad The combat is dull, the story bland, and it is just forgettable The artwork and graphics are incredibly dated Live service model is pointless 3 Written by Aran Suddi From the heady days of the Mega Drive up until the modern day gaming has been my main hobby. I'll give almost any game a go.
