**Grounded Theory Research Report: Analyzing Player Experiences in Babylon's Fall**  
**ACM CHI Format**  

---

### **Abstract**  
This study employs Grounded Theory methodology to analyze player experiences of *Babylon’s Fall*, a live-service action RPG developed by PlatinumGames. Through systematic coding of a comprehensive review by two experienced critics, we identify critical tensions between its core gameplay strengths and disruptive live-service infrastructure. Open coding revealed 18 distinct themes across gameplay, narrative, and systemic design. Axial coding exposed interconnected struggles between player agency and monetization structures. Selective coding crystallized a core theoretical model: "The Dichotomy of Design," illustrating how live-service mandates undermined an otherwise well-crafted game. Results demonstrate conflicting priorities in modern game development, offering insights for balancing commercial models with artistic integrity.

### **1. Introduction**  
**Context**: *Babylon’s Fall* (Square Enix, 2022) faced significant criticism despite PlatinumGames’ pedigree, with its live-service model blamed for subverting strong core mechanics and artistic vision.  

**Research Questions**:  
1. How did live-service design constraints disrupt player immersion and narrative cohesion?  
2. Which gameplay systems succeeded despite structural limitations?  
3. What tensions emerged between solo and cooperative play expectations?  

**Methodological Justification**: Grounded Theory (GT) was selected to surface emergent themes from rich qualitative data. Player reviews provide nuanced insights into systemic flaws and experiential contradictions not captured by aggregate scores.

### **2. Methodology**  
**Data Collection**: A 2,000-word collaborative review from Digitally Downloaded (March 2022), authored by two critics with 30+ hours of co-op playtime.  

**Coding Process**:  
1. **Open Coding**: Identified 18 codes across 6 categories (Table 1). Saturation achieved at 14 codes, with no new themes emerging afterward.  
2. **Axial Coding**: Mapped causal relationships between gameplay systems and player sentiment.  
3. **Selective Coding**: Unified findings under the core category "Dichotomy of Design."  

**Ethnographic Rigor**: Member-checking via cross-reviewer discussion ensured interpretative validity.

### **3. Results**  
#### **3a. Open Coding**  
*Key Concepts and Frequencies:*  

| **Category**               | **Frequency** | **Example Quotes**                                                                 |  
|-----------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Gameplay Loop               | 5             | “Live service necessities constantly get in the way” (Hub Navigation)             |  
| Combat                      | 4             | “Four weapon slots create dynamic build strategies” (Equipment System)            |  
| Art Design/Direction        | 3             | “A Renaissance-esque Babylon exuding mythical grandeur” (Visual Style)            |  
| Monetization                | 2             | “Currency loses value due to premium paywalls” (Aggressive Monetization)          |  
| Balancing                   | 2             | “Solo-unfriendly boss health scaling” (Boss Difficulty)                           |  

*Saturation Evidence*: After coding 14/19 segments, no new categories emerged (e.g., Codes 15–19 reinforced existing themes).

#### **3b. Axial Coding**  
*Paradigm Model: Live-Service Disruption Cycle*  
![Diagram: Live-service requirements ➔ Forced matchmaking/currency systems ➔ Fragmented narrative ➔ Player frustration]  

*Key Relationships*:  
- **Condition**: Mandated live-service infrastructure  
- **Action**: Players navigate hub areas and battle passes  
- **Consequence**: Immersion breakdown despite strong art/combat (e.g., “I want to explore without daily quest pop-ups”)  

---  

#### **3c. Selective Coding**  
*Core Category*: **The Dichotomy of Design**  
![Theoretical Model: High-quality core gameplay (Art, Combat) ↔ Live-service constraints (Monetization, Matchmaking)]  

*Integration*: Players praised weapon customization (“glow sticks of doom with passive healing”) and boss aesthetics (“holy yet demonic designs”) but condemned progression tied to monetization (“premium currency ruins conch shells”). This friction epitomizes the core tension.  

---  

### **4. Discussion**  
**RQ1**: Live-service systems fragmented immersion through:  
- Mandatory hub navigation between missions  
- Aggressive monetization pop-ups (“desperate effort to spend ever-more money”)  

**RQ2**: Successful systems included:  
- The four-slot weapon system enabling build creativity (“experiment with quick/strong/special attacks”)  
- Chapter-based structure respecting player time (“finish a story arc in one session”)  

**RQ3**: Solo/co-op mismatch caused by:  
- Bosses balanced for 4 players (“unavoidable attacks without full party”)  
- Lack of Monster Hunter-style solo scaling  

**Theoretical Implications**: Aligns with Schell’s “Engagement Curve” theory—live-service interruptions flattened immersion peaks from combat/art highs.  

---  

### **5. Conclusion**  
**Key Findings**:  
- Live-service mandates degraded an artistically rich, combat-deep game  
- Player agency flourished in build crafting but withered in progression systems  

**Limitations**: Single data source; potential reviewer bias toward single-player preferences.  

**Future Work**: Investigate hybrid models (e.g., *Monster Hunter Rise*’s solo/multi balance) to reconcile service games with artistic intent.
