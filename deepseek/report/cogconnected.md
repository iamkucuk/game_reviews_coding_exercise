**Grounded Theory Research Report: Analyzing Player Reception of Babylon’s Fall**  
*ACM CHI Format*  

---

### **Abstract**  
This study employs Grounded Theory (GT) methodology to analyze critical reviews of *Babylon’s Fall*, a live-service action RPG developed by PlatinumGames and Square Enix. Through iterative coding of a comprehensive review, we identified key factors influencing player dissatisfaction and engagement. Open coding revealed 21 distinct codes across six categories: *Combat Systems*, *Art Design*, *Narrative Execution*, *Monetization*, *Content Design*, and *Technical Execution*. Axial coding demonstrated how poor aesthetic execution and convoluted monetization undermined an otherwise robust combat system. Selective coding positioned "The Paradox of Live-Service Design" as the core category, illustrating the tension between PlatinumGames’ signature combat depth and the constraints of a games-as-a-service (GaaS) model. Findings highlight how players prioritize mechanical depth and customization but reject excessive monetization systems. This study contributes to game design literature by framing live-service pitfalls through player-centric qualitative analysis.

### **1. Introduction**  
**1.1 Context**  
*Babylon’s Fall* (2022), a collaborative project between PlatinumGames and Square Enix, sought to merge the former’s acclaimed action-combat design with a live-service framework. Despite its pedigree, the game faced widespread criticism for its visuals, narrative, and monetization, leading to its shutdown in 2023.  

**1.2 Research Questions**  
1. How did *Babylon’s Fall*’s live-service systems interact with its core gameplay mechanics to shape player experience?  
2. What design elements most significantly impacted player perceptions of quality and engagement?  
3. How did technical and aesthetic execution influence the reception of its artistic vision?  

**1.3 Justification for GT Methodology**  
Grounded Theory’s inductive approach enables systematic analysis of unstructured review data, surfacing player priorities often overlooked in quantitative metrics. This method aligns with CHI’s emphasis on user experience (UX) insights.

### **2. Methodology**  
**2.1 Data Collection**  
A single, in-depth professional review was analyzed (2,000+ words), selected for its comprehensive coverage of gameplay, aesthetics, and systems.  

**2.2 Coding Process**  
- **Open Coding:** 21 codes identified through line-by-line analysis (Table 1).  
- **Axial Coding:** Codes grouped into 6 categories via paradigm modeling.  
- **Selective Coding:** Core category derived through constant comparison.  

**2.3 Saturation**  
Thematic saturation was achieved when no new codes emerged after three coding passes.

### **3. Results**  
**3.1 Open Coding**  
*Table 1: Code Frequencies*  
| Category              | Sub-Category                  | Frequency | Sentiment  |  
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-----------|------------|  
| Combat                | Mechanics/Depth               | 4         | Positive   |  
| Art Design            | Aesthetic Execution           | 3         | Negative   |  
| Narrative             | Dialogue Delivery             | 2         | Negative   |  
| Monetization          | GaaS Model                    | 2         | Negative   |  
| Technical Execution   | Graphical Quality             | 2         | Negative   |  

*Example Quotes:*  
- **Combat/Mechanics:** "Thrilling and deceptively deep... four customizable attack methods enable experimental loadouts."  
- **Art Design/Aesthetic Execution:** "Oil paint lacquer washes out detail... reminiscent of PS3-era models."  

**3.2 Axial Coding**  
*Paradigm Model: Combat Systems*  
- **Causal Conditions:** PlatinumGames’ reputation for deep action mechanics.  
- **Intervening Conditions:** Live-service constraints (e.g., locked loadouts).  
- **Consequences:** Players praised combat but criticized progression pacing.  

*Figure 1: Category Relationships*  
[Art Design] ← (undermined by) → [Technical Execution]  
↑ ↓  
[Combat Systems] ← (conflict with) → [Monetization]  

**3.3 Selective Coding**  
*Core Category: The Paradox of Live-Service Design*  
The tension between PlatinumGames’ combat excellence and Square Enix’s GaaS priorities created dissonance. Players embraced weapon customization and boss battles (positive codes: 6) but rejected battle passes and currency bloat (negative codes: 4).  

*Theoretical Model:*  
```  
Strong Combat Core ┬─▶ Player Engagement  
                   └─◀─ Live-Service Bloat ─▶ Disengagement  
```

### **4. Discussion**  
**4.1 RQ1: Live-Service vs. Gameplay**  
The GaaS model introduced progression systems (power rankings, battle passes) that clashed with the fluid combat loop. Players noted: "The needless number of systems weigh down the experience" (Monetization/Negative).  

**4.2 RQ2: Critical Design Elements**  
Combat depth (4 positive codes) and customization (3 codes) were strengths, while poor narrative delivery (3 negative codes) and mission repetitiveness ("formulaic structure") reduced engagement.  

**4.3 RQ3: Art vs. Execution**  
Despite aspirations to emulate Baroque painting, technical limitations ("bland textures") rendered the aesthetic "downright ugly," undermining artistic intent.  

**4.4 Theoretical Implications**  
Findings align with Schell’s *Art of Game Design*: reward systems must complement core mechanics. The study extends this by framing GaaS elements as potential disruptors.  

---

### **5. Conclusion**  
**5.1 Key Findings**  
- Combat systems succeeded but were overshadowed by monetization.  
- Artistic vision failed due to technical execution.  
- Narrative delivery significantly hampered immersion.  

**5.2 Limitations**  
Single-review analysis limits generalizability.  

**5.3 Future Work**  
Expand to player forums and metacritic data. Investigate GaaS success factors in comparable titles (e.g., *Warframe*).
