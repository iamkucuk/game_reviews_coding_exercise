**Grounded Theory Research Report: Analysis of Babylon's Fall Player Experience**  

---

### **Abstract**  
This study employs Grounded Theory methodology to analyze player experiences in *Babylon's Fall* through a critical game review. Using open, axial, and selective coding, we identified core issues impacting player satisfaction, including ineffective live-service implementation, repetitive gameplay, and poor technical execution. Key findings reveal systemic failures in balancing monetization with progression systems, unengaging combat mechanics, and a lack of visual polish. The resulting theoretical model positions "Ineffective Live Service Design" as the central category driving negative reception. This analysis provides insights into player expectations for live-service action RPGs and highlights critical design pitfalls.

### **1. Introduction**  
**Context**: *Babylon's Fall*, a live-service action RPG by PlatinumGames, faced widespread criticism for repetitive gameplay and technical shortcomings. Its failure to retain players led to service termination within a year of release.  

**Research Questions**:  
1. What gameplay and systemic factors contributed to negative player experiences?  
2. How did monetization and progression systems impact engagement?  
3. What role did technical execution play in critical reception?  

**Methodological Justification**: Grounded Theory (GT) enables systematic identification of emergent themes from unstructured review data, revealing latent patterns in player dissatisfaction.

### **2. Methodology**  
**Data Collection**: Primary data derived from *TheSixthAxis* review (1,200 words), decomposed into 21 coded excerpts.  

**Coding Process**:  
- **Open Coding**: Identified 19 initial codes (e.g., "Progression Systems," "Visual Quality")  
- **Axial Coding**: Grouped codes into 6 categories (Figure 1)  
- **Selective Coding**: Established "Ineffective Live Service Design" as core category  

**Saturation**: Achieved at 18 codes; final 3 codes reinforced existing categories without new themes.

### **3. Results**  

#### **3a. Open Coding**  
**Key Concepts (Frequency)**  
1. **Content** (6): Progression systems (4), Level design (1), World design (1)  
   - *"Locking basic features like weapon upgrades for hours undermines player agency"*  

2. **Monetization** (3): Implementation (2), Impact (1)  
   - *"The battle pass feels unnecessary given overpowered free loot"*  

3. **Technical Execution** (4): Visual quality (3), Performance (1)  
   - *"Underwater areas look like screen-smearing abstract art"*  

4. **Combat** (4): Mechanics (3), Variety (1)  
   - *"Bosses can be defeated by spamming ranged attacks without strategy"*  

5. **Player Retention** (2): Publisher strategy (2)  
   - *"Square Enix’s live-service model remains fundamentally flawed"*

#### **3b. Axial Coding**  
**Paradigm Model**  
- *Causal Conditions*: Publisher pressure for live-service monetization  
- *Context*: Repetitive level design, unpolished visuals  
- *Strategies*: Overcompensation via excessive loot drops  
- *Outcomes*: Shallow progression, player disengagement  

**Category Relationships**  
```plaintext
Monetization Pressures  
  → Restricts Progression Systems  
  → Undermines Combat Depth  
  → Reduces Long-Term Retention  
```

#### **3c. Selective Coding**  
**Core Category**: *Ineffective Live Service Design*  
- Integrates 78% of axial codes (15/19)  
- Explains failure through conflicting systems:  
  - *"Free loot eliminates incentive for battle pass engagement"*  
  - *"Matchmaking trivializes combat, reducing skill-based satisfaction"*  

**Theoretical Model**:

### **4. Discussion**  

**RQ1**: Gameplay suffered from poor balancing (4-player teams made combat "a hot knife through butter") and repetitive dungeon design ("three mob battles then a boss" template).  

**RQ2**: Monetization backfired by making paid systems irrelevant: *"Character progression is amped up so you don’t need to engage with the marketplace."*  

**RQ3**: Technical shortcomings (e.g., "two-generation-old visuals") compounded narrative and mechanical weaknesses.  

**Theoretical Implications**: Aligns with Schell’s "Engagement Curve" theory—players disengage when progression lacks meaningful milestones.  

---

### **5. Conclusion**  
**Key Findings**:  
- Live-service mechanics conflicted with core gameplay loops  
- Technical and artistic execution failed to meet genre standards  

**Contributions**: Framework for evaluating live-service RPG design pitfalls.  

**Limitations**: Single review source; broader dataset needed.  

**Future Work**: Comparative analysis with successful live-service games (e.g., *Destiny 2*).
