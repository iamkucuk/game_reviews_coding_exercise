**Grounded Theory Analysis of Babylon's Fall Reception**  
*An ACM CHI Format Research Report*  

---

**Abstract**  
This study employs Grounded Theory methodology to analyze critical reception patterns of PlatinumGames' Babylon's Fall through a Metro News review. Through iterative open, axial, and selective coding of 24 coded excerpts, we identified systemic design failures across four core categories: predatory monetization (21% of codes), deficient combat systems (25%), incoherent art direction (21%), and repetitive gameplay loops (17%). Key findings reveal a causal relationship between live-service mechanics and player disengagement, exacerbated by technical shortcomings and aesthetic inconsistencies. The resultant theoretical model demonstrates how disjointed design priorities undermined PlatinumGames' signature strengths, yielding one of 2022’s worst-reviewed titles. This analysis provides a framework for evaluating live-service transitions in action-game studios.

**1. Introduction**  
**1.1 Context**  
Babylon's Fall (2022) marked PlatinumGames' inaugural live-service entry following acclaimed action titles like *Bayonetta* and *NieR:Automata*. Despite its developer pedigree, the game suffered catastrophic commercial and critical failure, with Steam concurrent players peaking below 1,100.  

**1.2 Research Questions**  
RQ1: What systemic design failures drove Babylon’s Fall’s negative reception?  
RQ2: How do monetization strategies interact with core gameplay in live-service transitions?  
RQ3: What lessons emerge about preserving studio identity in genre shifts?  

**1.3 Methodological Justification**  
Grounded Theory’s inductive approach enables unpacking emergent player experience patterns from rich qualitative data. The Metro News review provides concentrated expert evaluation containing 24 analyzable claims about design decisions and their impacts.

**2. Methodology**  
**2.1 Data Collection**  
Primary data: 1,800-word Metro News review (March 9, 2022) containing 24 coded excerpts across 8 categories.  

**2.2 Coding Process**  
- *Open Coding:* Identified 8 initial categories through line-by-line analysis (Table 1).  
- *Axial Coding:* Established relationships between categories through paradigm modeling (Figure 1).  
- *Selective Coding:* Derived core category "Systemic Design Failures" through constant comparison.  

**2.3 Saturation**  
No new categories emerged after three coding iterations. Theoretical saturation confirmed through exhaustive excerpt categorization.

**3. Results**  
**3.1 Open Coding Analysis**  
*Table 1: Code Frequencies*  
| Category                | Frequency | Representative Quote                          |  
|-------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|  
| Monetization            | 5 (21%)   | "£95 Digital Deluxe Edition [...] disgusting" |  
| Combat Mechanics        | 6 (25%)   | "Dull and mechanical [...] chore"             |  
| Art Direction           | 5 (21%)   | "Ugliest games we’ve ever seen"               |  
| Gameplay Loop           | 4 (17%)   | "Same arena battles repeated"                 |  
| Technical Execution     | 2 (8%)    | "Input lag [...] platforming frustration"     |  
| Narrative Design        | 1 (4%)    | "Broad-strokes FromSoftware imitation"        |  
| Player Retention        | 1 (4%)    | "Campaign completion = ordeal"                |  

**3.2 Axial Coding Paradigms**  
*Figure 1: Causal Relationships*  
[Monetization Strategies] → Limits Player Progression → Reduces Retention  
[Art Inconsistencies] → Breaks Immersion → Disengages Players  
[Repetitive Combat] → Fails Platinum Legacy → Erodes Trust  

**3.3 Selective Coding Model**  
*Core Category: Systemic Design Failures*  
Four interrelated dimensions explain reception collapse:  
1. **Monetization-Play Conflict:** Premium pricing (£59.99) with paywalled gear created "predatory duality" (cited 3x)  
2. **Identity Crisis:** Failed Soulsborne/Platinum hybrids: "Bayonetta without depth" (2x)  
3. **Aesthetic Disintegration:** Oil-painting filter over bland assets: "Visual trainwreck" (4x)  
4. **Live-Service Maladaptation:** Forced co-op in dead playerbase: "Destiny without players" (2x)  

---

**4. Discussion**  
**RQ1 Answer:** Failure stemmed from conflicting design axioms – Platinum’s character-action heritage clashed with live-service demands. Example: Spectral weapons added complexity but "looked silly" (Art) and "lacked progression" (Combat).  

**RQ2 Answer:** The £95 edition and battle pass created progression asymmetry: "Better gear locked behind paywalls despite £60 entry" (Monetization). This violated player expectations for premium titles.  

**RQ3 Implications:** Studios transitioning genres must preserve core competencies. Platinum’s combat depth was sacrificed for loot systems: "Four weapons concept wasted" (Combat).  

**Theoretical Contribution:** Proposes a "Live-Service Identity Fidelity" framework where mechanical/aesthetic coherence determines adaptation success.  

---

**5. Conclusion**  
**Key Findings:**  
- Monetization undermined combat’s reward cycle  
- Artistic experiments compromised thematic consistency  
- Live-service infrastructure lacked population support  

**Limitations:** Single-review analysis; future work should incorporate player forums.  

**Future Directions:** Investigate successful genre transitions (e.g., Monster Hunter World) using this model.
