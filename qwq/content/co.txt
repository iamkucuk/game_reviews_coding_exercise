Comment now Comments Babylon’s Fall – not Platinum quality (pic: Square Enix) The makers of Bayonetta and NieR:Automata release their first live service title and it is already one of the most memorable games of 2022. We’re really starting to worry about PlatinumGames. The Japanese developer has been behind some of our favourite action games of the last several generations, including Bayonetta 1 and 2, Vanquish, Metal Gear Rising, NieR:Automata, and Astral Chain. We even enjoyed Star Fox Zero, even though nobody else seemed to. They’ve been very quiet recently though and last month’s Sol Cresta was an uninspiring way to break years of silence. Compared to Babylon’s Fall though it’s suddenly looking like a modern masterpiece. Despite all the talk of not working on licensed games anymore, and moving into self-publishing, Sol Cresta was based on an existing licence and Babylon’s Fall is published by Square Enix. No doubt these deals were made before self-publishing became such a focus but what’s worrying here is that Platinum has said that the other big shake-up to their business is going to be a move into live service games , of which this is their first. They didn’t say they were going to make only live service games but for anyone that blanched at the mere idea, the fact that Babylon’s Fall is so shockingly awful may, in the end, be a good thing. It’s clear the game has already been a massive failure and so hopefully that will make them think twice about any similar releases in the future. Platinum may be one of our favourite developers but it’s not like they haven’t made bad games before. They had a brief stint developing low budget licensed games for Activision and while Transformers: Devastation turned out surprisingly well (probably because they knew and liked the franchise) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants In Manhattan and The Legend Of Korra were awful. We don’t imagine Babylon’s Fall has a particularly big budget but it’s certainly bigger than those games and while Square Enix has already done its best to disown the game, including refusing to send out review copies, presumably at one point they hoped it would become a lucrative new franchise. The concept is very straightforward, which is just the start of the problems, as you take the role of a ‘Sentinel’ who is trying to make their way to the top of a giant tower. The actual story is told in very broad strokes, with the whole game channelling FromSoftware in terms of its narrative style and even elements of the interface, although the action is more traditionally Platinum-esque. That means it’s a third person melee game, where you use a range of both normal weapons and ghostly ones that float weirdly above your shoulder, which both gets in the way and looks silly. The ‘spectral weapons’ depend on a special gauge being filled, which recharges over time and as you perform normal attacks. The only thing close to an interesting idea is that you can switch which weapons are held in what are essentially each of your four hands (making it so you were actually a four-armed monster would’ve been vastly more interesting than just floating in mid-air, and exactly the sort of thing we’d normally expect of Platinum). Depending on which hand is holding a weapon, its nature is changed significantly, with melee weapons switching focus from swift to heavy attacks and ranged weapons acting like either rapid fire machineguns or mortar shells. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586IA3nhXpw Apart from picking up new weapons though the combat never evolves beyond its initial state, so once you’ve had a go on each weapon type you’ve basically seen everything the game has to offer. The lack of nuance and variety is baffling given Platinum’s previous work – even the jump doesn’t seem to work properly, with a weird input lag that makes the relatively common platform sections especially tiresome. There’s also the issue that Babylon’s Fall is without doubt one of the ugliest video games we’ve ever seen. The graphics underneath are under-detailed and blandly designed as it is, like a FromSoftware game with all the imagination and splendour drained out it, but, literally, pasted on top is a weird filter that’s meant to look like brush strokes on an oil painting. Ignoring the disconnect between combining a game that’s meant to be set in ancient Mesopotamia and painting styles from Renaissance era Europe, it just looks awful and is the sort of idea that should’ve been shot down five minutes after it was first tested. In truth, the whole game should’ve been dismissed in a similar manner, as there’s absolutely no hook to it. You just enter a small sealed-off arena, kill all the enemies in it – most of which spawn in without warning or just stand around listlessly until you attack them – and then move on to do the same again and again, as on your way to the next arena you traipse through linear corridors filled with silly-looking traps and absolutely nothing approaching an interesting idea. It’s basically Bayonneta without any of the depth, variety, imagination, charm, or colour. Which leaves so little left it’s almost impossible to understand what Platinum were even aiming for – other than a vague attempt to be Destiny but with melee combat. Trying to copy Bungie means four-player co-op and random loot, but the PC usersbase was already less than a thousand on launch day and it doesn’t seem any better on PlayStation, so unless you’ve got some friends with really bad taste in video games the chances of playing in a team of four are already low. Even the loot is a disappointment because it’s based on how well you perform, so there’s little chance of getting lucky and if you’re bad at the game you’re probably going to stay that way because there’s no easy way to get better gear for those that need it the most… except if you buy it with real money. Despite being £60, even on PlayStation 4 and PC, the game is riddled with microtransactions and the Digital Deluxe Edition is an eye-watering £95. Babylon’s Fall – even if it was free-to-play it’d be too expensive (pic: Square Enix) There’s also a premium battle pass where most of the items are cosmetic (which is pointless given the terrible art design) but does include crafting materials and in-game currency. The game’s approach to loot and microtransactions is so dreadful though it’s hard to judge which element is the worst, but it’s probably the fact that so few of the weapons you earn through gameplay are in anyway interesting – they usually just look exactly the same but with different stats or enchantments – and yet the in-game store is filled with cooler looking ones you have to buy with real money. As an extra irritation you can’t examine or use loot during a mission, it has to be taken back to the hub area first. You also can’t change your loadout in co-op, which makes it impossible to try and coordinate with the other players unless you organise in advance. The idea of rewarding better play, such as varying your attacks and using dodges, with loot makes sense in theory but the combat is so dull and mechanical it quickly begins to feel like a chore you have to get through, like the video game equivalent of vacuuming the floor. There are so many enemies constantly spawning in, and bosses take so long to whittle down, that it’s impossible to stay excited through a single encounter let alone an extended play session. More Trending Why I’ve decided to get a Nintendo Switch 2 instead of a PS5 - Reader’s Feature Channel: Gaming Gaming 2 days ago By GameCentral One of the best game reboots ever is on sale for less than £2 90s Nintendo console runs faster as it gets older and no one knows why Switch 2 to be most expensive Nintendo console and biggest launch ever The long battles are clearly meant to be another nod to FromSoftware but the bosses aren’t particularly hard, they just have a really big health bar. Combined with everything else in the game this suggests that Platinum just don’t understand the Soulsborne formula and lifting parts of it out to combine with their usual third person action has proven a disaster. Add in the disgusting approach to microtransctions and the bizarrely awful visuals and you have got a clear contender for worst game of 2022. Within just a few hours of starting to play Babylon’s Fall, the idea of finishing the main campaign seems like an ordeal you’d pay good money to avoid, which makes the price of the game, and what it expects you to spend on top, almost seem more absurd than offensive. Babylon’s Fall review summary In Short: Not only the worst game Platinum has ever made but one of the worst live service titles of any kind, with an especially disgusting attitude towards microtransactions. Pros: Having four weapons in play at once is an interesting idea, even if it’s presented in the least appealing fashion possible. Cons: Dull and repetitive combat, with enemies that seem to take an eternity to defeat. Hideously expensive, with mountains of microtransactions and no interesting loot. Terrible graphics.
