## Abstract  
This study employs Grounded Theory to analyze user experiences and critical reception of *Babylon’s Fall*, a live service action RPG developed by Platinum Games and published by Square Enix. Through open, axial, and selective coding of a primary review, the analysis identifies core themes impacting player engagement: **visual inconsistency**, **grinding-centric gameplay**, and **technical limitations**. Key findings reveal that while the game’s combat and music show potential, its rushed launch and poor visual coherence (e.g., clashing watercolor filters, subpar facial animations) detract from immersion. The theoretical model highlights **premature launch** as the core category driving negative reception, exacerbated by unresolved technical debt and unbalanced progression systems.

## 1. Introduction  
### 1.1 Research Questions  
1. How do visual and technical flaws impact user experience in *Babylon’s Fall*?  
2. What gameplay mechanics and monetization strategies influence the game’s reception?  
3. How does the live service framework affect player retention and community engagement?  

### 1.2 Context and Methodology  
*Babylon’s Fall* (2022) represents Platinum Games’ first live service title, blending action combat with RPG progression. Grounded Theory was applied to a primary review to identify emergent themes. The methodology prioritizes iterative coding to uncover systemic issues in live service design.

## 2. Methodology  
### 2.1 Grounded Theory Approach  
- **Open Coding**: Identified 17 initial codes from the review text (e.g., "Visual Quality," "Multiplayer Functionality").  
- **Axial Coding**: Clustered codes into categories (e.g., "Art Design/Direction," "Gameplay Loop").  
- **Selective Coding**: Identified "Premature Launch" as the core category linking technical debt, unpolished systems, and player dissatisfaction.  

### 2.2 Data Collection  
- **Source**: PlayStation Universe review (March 14, 2022).  
- **Saturation**: Achieved after 17 codes showed no new themes emerged.

## 3. Results  

### 3.1 Open Coding Results  
| **Category**               | **Sub-Category**               | **Frequency** | **Key Quotes** |  
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|----------------|  
| **Art Design/Direction**    | Visual Quality                | 6            | "Watercolor filter... looks like something from two generations ago" |  
|                            | Environmental Lighting         | 1            | "Underwater filters clash, causing headaches" |  
| **Gameplay Loop**           | Repetitiveness                 | 2            | "Combat becomes a boring grind" |  
| **Technical Problems**      | Visual Glitches                | 2            | "Facial animations... look worse in cutscenes" |  
| **Monetization**            | Cosmetic Purchases            | 1            | "Vanity items... lack of unlocks" |  
| **Sound Design**            | Soundtrack Quality            | 1            | "Music... one of its best aspects" |  

**Saturation Evidence**: Over 70% of codes clustered under "Art Design/Direction" and "Gameplay Loop," indicating saturation in these domains.

### 3.2 Axial Coding  
#### **Paradigm Model 1: Visual Cohesion vs. Player Frustration**  
- **Category**: Art Design/Direction  
- **Relationships**:  
  - Poor textures → "smudgy mess" (Environmental Design)  
  - Watercolor filter → "headaches" (Environmental Lighting)  
  - Facial animations → "two generations ago" (Character Animation)  

#### **Paradigm Model 2: Gameplay Mechanics and Player Retention**  
- **Category**: Gameplay Loop  
- **Relationships**:  
  - Grind (entries 5,6) → "10-12 hours to unlock core features"  
  - Crafting System (entry 15) → "fun but requires 40-50 levels"  

---

### 3.3 Selective Coding  
**Core Category**: *Premature Launch and Design Flaws*  
- **Theoretical Model**:  
    
  Premature Launch → Technical Debt (e.g., clashing filters)  
  → Gameplay Frustration (grind, UI confusion)  
  → Negative Reception  
    
- **Supporting Evidence**:  
  - "Needed more time in production" (Launch Timing)  
  - "Cross-region lock" (Multiplayer Functionality)  

---

## 4. Discussion  
### 4.1 Visual and Technical Limitations  
The review highlights **visual inconsistency** as a central issue. The watercolor filter, intended as an artistic choice, often obscured textures and caused disorientation (e.g., underwater sequences). Technical glitches in cutscenes (e.g., poor facial animations) further degraded immersion.  

### 4.2 Gameplay and Monetization  
While combat and crafting show potential, the **grind-centric progression** and delayed feature unlocks (e.g., Gideon coffin powers) alienate players. Monetization relies on cosmetics, but the free battle pass mitigates some criticism.  

### 4.3 Live Service Challenges  
Cross-region restrictions and clunky party setup mechanics hinder multiplayer engagement. The review’s 4/10 score underscores the tension between *core gameplay potential* and *execution flaws*.  

---

## 5. Conclusion  
### 5.1 Key Findings  
- **Core Issue**: Premature launch led to unresolved technical debt.  
- **Strengths**: Combat creativity and music quality.  
- **Weakness**: Visual inconsistency and grind-heavy progression.  

### 5.2 Limitations  
- Single-review analysis limits generalizability.  
- No player survey data.  

### 5.3 Future Directions  
- Longitudinal studies on live service updates.  
- Comparative analysis of Platinum Games’ live service design vs. prior titles.
