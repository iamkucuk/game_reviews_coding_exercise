# Grounded Theory Analysis of Babylon’s Fall: A Study of User Experience and Critical Reception  

---

## Abstract  
This study employs Grounded Theory to analyze critical reviews of *Babylon’s Fall*, a looter-slasher developed by Platinum Games and published by Square Enix. The analysis focuses on gameplay mechanics, narrative coherence, visual design, and monetization strategies. Through open, axial, and selective coding of a primary review, key themes emerged: repetitive gameplay loops, subpar visual design, and intrusive monetization. Findings reveal that the game’s reliance on formulaic mechanics and lack of innovation led to negative reception, exacerbated by poor technical execution and narrative incoherence. The theoretical model identifies the **"failure to innovate"** as the core category driving player dissatisfaction.

## 1. Introduction  

### 1.1 Context  
*Babylon’s Fall* (2022) is a third-person action RPG developed by Platinum Games and published by Square Enix. Marketed as a "melee grindathon," it features looter-slasher mechanics, a Battle Pass, and a narrative centered on a plague-ridden world. Despite its pedigree, the game received mixed reviews, with critics citing repetitive gameplay and poor visual design.  

### 1.2 Research Questions  
1. How does the repetitive gameplay loop affect user engagement and satisfaction?  
2. What role do visual and narrative shortcomings play in shaping critical reception?  
3. How do monetization strategies influence player perception and retention?  

### 1.3 Grounded Theory Justification  
Grounded Theory (GT) is ideal for exploring emergent themes in user experiences without preconceived hypotheses. This approach allows identification of systemic issues in *Babylon’s Fall* through iterative coding of critical feedback.

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 Data Collection  
- **Source**: A single review from *GodisaGeek.com* (March 2022) by Mick Fraser.  
- **Scope**: 2,500-word review covering gameplay, visuals, narrative, and monetization.  

### 2.2 Coding Process  
1. **Open Coding**: Identified 22 initial codes (e.g., "Game Repetitiveness," "Visual Glitches").  
2. **Axial Coding**: Linked codes to broader categories (e.g., "Monetization Strategies" → "Player Retention").  
3. **Selective Coding**: Identified **"Failure to Innovate"** as the core category.  

### 2.3 Saturation  
Saturation was achieved after three iterations, with no new codes emerging from the review.

## 3. Results  

### 3.1 Open Coding  
#### Key Codes and Frequencies  
| **Category**               | **Sub-Category**               | **Frequency** | **Example Quote** |  
|----------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------|-------------------|  
| Gameplay Loop              | Game Repetitiveness            | 5            | "The core loop is particularly bad" |  
|                          | Lack of Variety                | 3            | "No deviation on combos" |  
| Combat                     | Combat Execution               | 3            | "Tedious combat" |  
| Art Design/Direction        | Visual Quality                 | 4            | "Looks awful" |  
| Monetization               | Microtransactions              | 3            | "Battle Pass is front and centre" |  
| Story                     | Narrative Coherence            | 2            | "Story is garbled nonsense" |

### 3.2 Axial Coding  
#### Paradigm Model  
  
[Gameplay Loop (cause)]  
→ [Player Engagement (context)]  
→ [Monetization (intervention)]  
→ [Negative Reception (outcome)]  
  

#### Key Relationships  
- **Gameplay Repetitiveness** → **Diminished Player Retention**  
- **Poor Visual Design** → **Perceived Lack of Polish**  
- **Battle Pass Prominence** → **Perceived Exploitative Monetization**  

---

### 3.3 Selective Coding  
#### Core Category: **"Failure to Innovate"**  
- **Definition**: The game’s reliance on unoriginal mechanics, generic aesthetics, and exploitative monetization undermines its appeal.  
- **Supporting Evidence**:  
  - "Platinum Games operating on autopilot" (Review, 2022).  
  - "Looks like something from the PS2 era" (Review, 2022).

## 4. Discussion  

### 4.1 Research Question 1: Gameplay Repetitiveness  
The review highlights a **lack of innovation in core mechanics**, with combat reduced to "repetition for the sake of it." The absence of meaningful progression or varied enemy design ("bland sequence of monster rooms") led to player disengagement.  

### 4.2 Research Question 2: Visual and Narrative Shortcomings  
The "oil painting aesthetic" backfired, resulting in "subpar visuals" and "PS2-era character models." The narrative’s "garbled nonsense" further alienated players, contrasting with Platinum’s prior narrative-driven titles like *Bayonetta*.  

### 4.3 Research Question 3: Monetization Strategies  
The Battle Pass’s prominence and "cash shop" placement signaled a shift toward exploitative monetization, undermining perceived value. This contrasts with the studio’s traditional focus on gameplay depth.  

### 4.4 Theoretical Implications  
The findings align with prior studies on looter-slashers (e.g., *Godfall* comparisons) but emphasize the unique harm of unpolished AAA titles. The core category of "failure to innovate" underscores risks of formulaic design in competitive markets.

## 5. Conclusion  

### 5.1 Key Findings  
- **Gameplay**: Repetitive loops and lack of depth led to player disengagement.  
- **Design**: Outdated visuals and weak narrative diluted immersion.  
- **Monetization**: Battle Pass prominence prioritized revenue over player experience.  

### 5.2 Limitations  
- Single-review analysis limits generalizability.  
- No player survey data available.  

### 5.3 Future Research  
- Cross-review analysis of Platinum Games’ post-2020 titles.  
- Player surveys on monetization tolerance in looter-slashers.
