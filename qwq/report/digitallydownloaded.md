# Grounded Theory Analysis of Babylon’s Fall: A Clash of Vision and Monetization  

---

## Abstract  
This study employs Grounded Theory to analyze user reviews of *Babylon’s Fall*, a live service multiplayer RPG developed by PlatinumGames and published by Square Enix. Through open, axial, and selective coding of critical discourse, the research identifies a central tension between the game’s artistic and mechanical strengths and its restrictive live service framework. Key findings reveal that while the game excels in combat refinement, world-building, and mythological authenticity, its forced multiplayer structure, intrusive monetization, and disjointed narrative integration undermine its potential. The core category of **"Clash of Vision and Monetization"** emerges as the theoretical framework explaining the game’s mixed reception.

## 1. Introduction  

### Context  
*Babylon’s Fall* (2022) is a multiplayer action RPG designed as a live service title, blending PlatinumGames’ combat expertise with a mythological Babylonian setting. Despite its ambitious design, it faced criticism for its rigid multiplayer requirements, intrusive monetization, and narrative fragmentation.  

### Research Questions  
1. How does the live service structure impact user experience in *Babylon’s Fall*?  
2. What gameplay and design elements contribute to its mixed reception?  
3. How do monetization strategies affect player immersion and retention?  

### Methodological Justification  
Grounded Theory is ideal for exploring the emergent tensions between design intent and commercial constraints, which are not explicitly stated in reviews but inferred through thematic patterns.  

---

## 2. Methodology  

### Grounded Theory Approach  
- **Open Coding**: Identified 21 initial codes from the review text (e.g., *Boss Balance*, *Loot System*).  
- **Axial Coding**: Linked codes to categories (e.g., *Monetization Strategy* → *Live Service Integration*).  
- **Selective Coding**: Identified the core category *Clash of Vision and Monetization* as the central theme.  

### Data Collection  
- **Source**: A single in-depth review from Digitally Downloaded (DDNet) by Matt S. and Matt R.  
- **Saturation**: Achieved after iterative coding passes, with no new codes emerging after analyzing 14 distinct themes.

## 3. Results  

### 3.1 Open Coding Results  

| **Category**               | **Sub-Category**          | **Sentiment** | **Frequency** | **Key Quotes** |  
|----------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|  
| Gameplay Loop              | Co-op Dynamics           | Negative      | 3             | *"Pairing up with randoms... everything went by in a blur."* |  
|                           | Level Design              | Positive      | 2             | *"Levels have interesting quirks..."* |  
| Monetization               | Currency Mechanics       | Negative      | 2             | *"Conch shells... lose all value..."* |  
| Art Design                 | Mythological Research      | Positive      | 3             | *"Bestiary... researched from myths of the era."* |  
| Combat                     | Core Mechanics           | Positive      | 4             | *"Combat system benefits from Platinum’s refinement."* |  

**Saturation Evidence**: The code *Live Service Integration* appeared in 5+ contexts, indicating saturation.

### 3.2 Axial Coding  

#### **Paradigm Model**  
![Paradigm Model](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=Core+Category:+Clash+of+Vision+and+Monetization)  
*Figure 1: Axial Relationships*  
- **Axis 1**: *Artistic Vision* (World Building, Combat Refinement) → *Player Satisfaction*  
- **Axis 2**: *Monetization Strategy* (Live Service Integration, Currency Mechanics) → *Player Frustration*  

#### Key Relationships  
- **Narrative Cohesion** negatively correlated with *Live Service Requirements* (e.g., forced hubs disrupting story flow).  
- *Loot System* positively influenced *Experimentation* but was overshadowed by *Monetization Prompts*.  

---

### 3.3 Selective Coding  

#### Core Category: **Clash of Vision and Monetization**  
- **Definition**: The conflict between PlatinumGames’ narrative-driven design and Square Enix’s live service monetization priorities.  
- **Supporting Evidence**:  
  - *"It was probably intended to be a single-player narrative-driven thing, but then someone decided it should be a live service thing instead."* (Matt S)  
  - *"Monetization prompts constantly disrupt the mood."*  

#### Theoretical Model  
  
Core Category: Clash of Vision and Monetization  
├─ Artistic Vision (Art, Combat, Story)  
├─ Monetization Pressures (Live Service, Currency)  
└─ Player Experience (Fragmented vs. Enjoyable)

## 4. Discussion  

### Research Question 1: Live Service Impact  
The forced multiplayer structure (e.g., 4-player boss balance in 2-player scenarios) creates frustration, while episodic chapter design offers a *Dungeons & Dragons*-like flexibility.  

### Research Question 2: Gameplay Strengths/Weaknesses  
- **Strengths**: Combat’s *Core Mechanics* (4-weapon slots) and *Mythological Research* (angelic/demonic boss designs) are praised.  
- **Weaknesses**: Disjointed storytelling (e.g., key allies "disappearing") and linear level design limit immersion.  

### Research Question 3: Monetization Effects  
Premium currency devaluation and intrusive prompts (e.g., "desperate" spending prompts) alienate players, contrasting with the game’s *Content Richness*.  

### Theoretical Implications  
The study highlights the risks of retrofitting live service mechanics onto narrative-driven games. This aligns with prior work on *MMO fatigue* (e.g., *Final Fantasy XIV*’s contrast with *Babylon’s Fall*).

## 5. Conclusion  

### Key Findings  
- *Babylon’s Fall* succeeds in combat, art, and lore but is hampered by structural and monetization flaws.  
- The core category of *Clash of Vision and Monetization* explains its polarized reception.  

### Limitations  
- Single-review analysis limits generalizability.  
- No player survey data to validate reviewer perceptions.  

### Future Research  
- Longitudinal studies on live service games’ design compromises.  
- Player surveys to quantify monetization frustration.
