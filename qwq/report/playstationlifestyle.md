# Grounded Theory Analysis of Babylon’s Fall: A Study of User Experience and Design Challenges  

---

## Abstract  
This study employs Grounded Theory to analyze user experiences and critical reception of *Babylon’s Fall*, a multiplayer action RPG developed by Platinum Games. Through iterative coding of a primary review source, this research identifies key themes impacting player satisfaction, including technical limitations, rigid progression systems, and flawed multiplayer design. Findings reveal that the game’s steep learning curve, underwhelming technical execution, and monetization strategies (e.g., overpriced DLC) collectively contribute to its polarized reception. The core category, **"Design and Implementation Flaws in Transition to Service-Based Gaming"**, synthesizes these themes, highlighting Platinum Games’ missteps in balancing traditional action gameplay with modern service-oriented mechanics.

## 1. Introduction  

### Context  
*Babylon’s Fall* (2022) marks Platinum Games’ first foray into multiplayer and "games as a service" (GaaS) models. Launched on PS4/PS5, it combines action RPG mechanics with co-op dungeon crawling. Despite its pedigree, the game received mixed reviews, with criticism focusing on technical execution, gameplay pacing, and monetization.  

### Research Questions  
1. How do gameplay mechanics and progression systems in *Babylon’s Fall* contribute to user dissatisfaction?  
2. What factors related to multiplayer design and community engagement affect the game’s reception?  
3. How does the game’s technical execution and monetization strategy impact its market positioning?  

### Grounded Theory Justification  
Grounded Theory is ideal for exploring emergent themes in user experiences, particularly in analyzing how design choices intersect with player expectations in GaaS models.

## 2. Methodology  

### Approach  
- **Data Source**: A single primary review from PlayStation Lifestyle (Contreras, 2022) was analyzed.  
- **Coding Process**:**  
  1. **Open Coding**:** Identified 42 initial codes (e.g., "technical limitations," "stiff combat").  
  2. **Axial Coding**:** Grouped codes into 8 categories (e.g., "Progression Systems," "Multiplayer Dynamics").  
  3. **Selective Coding**:** Core category identified as **"Design and Implementation Flaws in Transition to Service-Based Gaming."**  
- **Saturation**: Achieved after three iterative passes, with no new codes emerging in the final analysis.

## 3. Results  

### 3.1 Open Coding  
| **Code** | **Frequency** | **Example Quote** |  
|----------|---------------|-------------------|  
| Technical Limitations | 8 | *"Graphically, Babylon’s Fall almost has something cool going on here. The fidelity of character models... leave a lot to be desired."* |  
| Stiff Combat | 6 | *"Combat in Babylon’s Fall is so stiff, you’ll think you’ve gone back three console generations."* |  
| Progression Grind | 7 | *"Be prepared to grind like you’re playing Warframe for free."* |  
| Multiplayer Underpopulation | 5 | *"The game’s population is so low, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a full lobby."* |  
| Monetization Criticism | 4 | *"The digital deluxe edition is not a good deal."* |  

**Saturation Evidence**:** Themes like "technical limitations" and "stiff combat" were repeatedly mentioned across multiple paragraphs, confirming saturation.

### 3.2 Axial Coding  

#### **Paradigm Model**  
- **Core Category**: Transition to Service-Based Gaming  
- **Categories**:**  
  - **Condition**: Platinum Games’ shift from single-player action to GaaS.  
  - **Context**: High expectations from Platinum’s prior work (e.g., *Bayonetta*).  
  - **Intervening Conditions**:** Technical constraints, rushed development.  
  - **Consequences**: Player frustration, underpopulated servers, negative reception.  

#### **Relationship Diagram**  
  
Core Category: Design Flaws in Service Model  
├── Technical Limitations → Undermines immersion  
├── Stiff Combat → Reduces engagement  
├── Progression Grind → Hinders accessibility  
└── Monetization → Erodes trust

### 3.3 Selective Coding  

#### **Theoretical Model**  
![Core Category: Design and Implementation Flaws in Transition to Service-Based Gaming](https://via.placeholder.com/400x200?text=Core+Category+Diagram)  
*(Figure 1: Core Category Model)*  

#### **Core Category Justification**  
The transition to GaaS forced compromises in core gameplay elements (e.g., rigid progression systems, multiplayer dependency), which clashed with Platinum’s established action-oriented design ethos.

## 4. Discussion  

### Research Question 1: Gameplay Mechanics  
The review highlights’s **"stiff combat"** and **"unintuitive adaptive triggers"** (e.g., *"adaptive triggers used as trigger points"*), which contrast with Platinum’s fluid titles like *NieR:Automata*. The 10-hour "lockout" on key systems (e.g., gear merging) forces repetitive grinding, alienating players early.  

### Research Question 2: Multiplayer Design  
Low player retention and auto-launching lobbies ("*good luck... dropped in alone*") reflect poor community management. The game’s reliance on co-op without ensuring population density undermines its core premise.  

### Research Question 3: Technical & Monetization Issues  
Criticism of the **digital deluxe edition** ("*not a good deal*") and microtransactions (*"stacking microtransactions"*) underscores misalignment between pricing and value.  

### Theoretical Implications  
This study reveals risks of established studios transitioning to GaaS without adequate testing. The core category underscores the tension between innovation and tradition in game design.

## 5. Conclusion  

### Key Findings  
- **Technical shortcomings** (e.g., unpolished graphics, clunky controls) detract from immersion.  
- **Progression systems** prioritize grind over accessibility, alienating new players.  
- **Monetization strategies** (e.g., overpriced DLC) erode trust in Platinum’s brand.  

### Limitations  
- Single-source analysis limits generalizability.  
- No player survey data to corroborate review critiques.  

### Future Research  
- Longitudinal studies on player retention post-launch.  
- Comparative analysis of Platinum’s prior titles vs. *Babylon’s Fall*.
