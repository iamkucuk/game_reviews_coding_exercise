## Abstract  
This study employs Grounded Theory to analyze user experiences and critical reception of *Babylon’s Fall*, a live-service action RPG developed by PlatinumGames and Square Enix. Through open, axial, and selective coding of review data, the analysis identifies core themes of **outdated gameplay mechanics**, **poor character customization**, and **exploitative monetization strategies** as central to the game’s negative reception. Key findings reveal that clunky combat, generic narrative, and racially insensitive character creation options undermine player engagement, while live-service elements like pay-to win Battle Pass mechanics exacerbate dissatisfaction. The theoretical model highlights how these systemic flaws interact to create a "dated design-Driven dissonance" that overshadows the game’s technical competence.

## 1. Introduction  

### 1.1 Research Questions  
1. How do outdated gameplay mechanics and systemic design choices impact user engagement in *Babylon’s Fall*?  
2. In what ways do racial insensitivity in character customization and generic visual design contribute to negative player perceptions?  
3. What role do live-service monetization strategies play in shaping the game’s market reception?  

### 1.2 Methodological Justification  
Grounded Theory is applied to systematically analyze critical reviews of *Babylon’s Fall*, focusing on emergent themes in gameplay, narrative, and monetization. This approach allows identification of causal relationships between design choices and user experiences, addressing gaps in prior AAA live-service game studies.

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 Data Collection  
- **Source**: Shacknews review (March 2022) and associated forum discussions  
- **Sample**: 22 coded review excerpts  
- **Coding Process**:  
  1. **Open Coding**: Identified 18 distinct codes (e.g., "Combat Pacing," "Character Customization")  
  2. **Axial Coding**: Clustered codes into 6 core categories (e.g., "Gameplay Loop," "Monetization")  
  3. **Selective Coding**: Identified "Outdated Design-Driven Dissonance" as core category  

### 2.2 Saturation Determination  
Saturation achieved when no new codes emerged after analyzing 3rd review iteration.

## 3. Results  

### 3.1 Open Coding Results  

#### Table 1: Code Frequencies  
| Category               | Sub-Category               | Frequency | Sentiment |  
|------------------------|----------------------------|-----------|-----------|  
| Gameplay Loop          | Combat Pacing               | 2         | Negative  |  
| Gameplay Loop          | Movement Mechanics          | 2         | Mixed     |  
| Gameplay Loop          | Gameplay Innovation        | 2         | Mixed     |  
| Art Design/Direction    | Visual Aesthetic           | 3         | Negative  |  
| UI/UX                  | Character Customization      | 3         | Negative  |  
| Monetization            | Battle Pass/Microtransactions | 3         | Negative  |  
| Story                  | Narrative Engagement       | 2         | Negative  |  

#### Key Concepts Identified  
- **Outdated Gameplay**: "Combat feels dated and slow" (Combat Pacing)  
- **Racial Erasure**: "Darkest skin tone nowhere near realistic" (Character Customization)  
- **Pay-to-Win Concerns**: "Battle Pass includes pay-to win resources" (Monetization)

### 3.2 Axial Coding  

#### Figure 1: Paradigm Model  
  
[Outdated Gameplay]  
       ↕  
[Visual Dissonance]  
       ↕  
[Racial Insensitivity]  
       ↕  
[Monetization Exploitation]  
  

#### Core Relationships  
- **Gameplay Loop → User Engagement**: Clunky combat (e.g., "animations don’t blend smoothly") directly correlates with negative reception  
- **Monetization → Player Trust**: Pay-to win concerns ("Premium Battle Pass resources") reduce perceived fairness  

---

### 3.3 Selective Coding  

#### Core Category: **Outdated Design-Driven Dissonance**  
- **Mechanical Dissonance**: "Combat feels like early PS3 era" (Launch Timing)  
- **Aesthetic Dissonance**: "Medieval oil painting style feels outdated" (Visual Aesthetic)  
- **Ethical Dissonance**: "Abysmal character creation options" (Character Customization)  

#### Theoretical Model  
  
[Core Category: Outdated Design-Driven Dissonance]  
       ↕  
[Gameplay Loop Flaws] → [User Engagement Decline]  
       ↕  
[Visual/Artistic Failures] → [Aesthetic Disconnect]  
       ↕  
[Monetization Strategies] → [Player Alienation]

## 4. Discussion  

### 4.1 Research Question 1: Gameplay Mechanics  
The review highlights **dated combat systems** ("clunky movement," "generic fantasy environments") and **lack of innovation** ("paint by numbers gameplay"). These elements contrast sharply with PlatinumGames’ prior work, creating dissonance with player expectations.  

### 4.2 Research Question 2: Customization and Aesthetics  
The "abysmal" character creation system’s racial insensitivity ("darkest skin tone too light") and generic art direction ("visually unappealing") create identity dissonance for players seeking representation and immersion.  

### 4.3 Research Question 3: Monetization  
The Battle Pass’s exploitative design ("pay-to-win concerns") and lack of live-service quality ("weak live-service elements") reflect broader industry trends of prioritizing revenue over player experience.  

---

## 5. Conclusion  

### 5.1 Key Findings  
- **Core Issue**: Outdated design choices and exploitative monetization override technical competence  
- **Ethical Concerns**: Racial insensitivity in character creation undermines inclusivity  

### 5.2 Limitations  
- Single-review analysis limits generalizability  
- No player demographic data  

### 5.3 Future Directions  
- Longitudinal studies on live-service fatigue  
- Cross-cultural analysis of character customization preferences
