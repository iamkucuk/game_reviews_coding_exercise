# Grounded Theory Research Report: User Experience and Critical Reception of *Babylon’s Fall*  

---

## Abstract  
This study employs Grounded Theory to analyze the critical reception of *Babylon’s Fall*, a live-service action RPG developed by PlatinumGames and Square Enix. Using a single-source dataset (a VGC review), the analysis identifies core themes influencing player and critical dissatisfaction, including dated visuals, unengaging combat, intrusive monetization, and poor mission design. Open coding revealed 12 primary codes, including "Visual Datedness," "Combat Mediocrity," and "Microtransactions." Axial coding highlighted the interplay between these codes, culminating in a core category: **"Failure of Live-Service Integration in *Babylon’s Fall*."** Findings suggest that the game’s reliance on live-service mechanics (e.g., Battle Passes, loot systems) clashed with its $60 price tag and underwhelming core gameplay, alienating players. The study underscores the risks of prioritizing monetization over foundational design in AAA live-service titles.

## 1. Introduction  

### 1.1 Context  
*Babylon’s Fall* (2022) is a third-person action RPG co-developed by PlatinumGames and Square Enix, positioned as a live-service title with microtransactions and post-launch content. Its launch was met with severe criticism, particularly for its dated visuals, repetitive combat, and aggressive monetization.  

### 1.2 Research Questions  
1. How do live-service mechanics (e.g., microtransactions, Battle Passes) impact user experience in *Babylon’s Fall*?  
2. What aspects of gameplay design (combat, mission structure) contributed to its negative reception?  
3. How does the game’s execution compare to industry standards for live-service and PlatinumGames’ prior work?  

### 1.3 Grounded Theory Justification  
Grounded Theory is ideal for exploring emergent themes in a novel context (live-service AAA titles). The methodology allows iterative coding to uncover systemic issues in *Babylon’s Fall*’s design and monetization.

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 Data Collection  
- **Source**: A single review from VGC (March 2022), totaling ~1,500 words.  
- **Scope**: Focused on critical analysis of gameplay, visuals, monetization, and developer intent.  

### 2.2 Coding Process  
1. **Open Coding**: Identified 12 primary codes through line-by-line analysis.  
2. **Axial Coding**: Linked codes to form categories (e.g., "Monetization Aggression" → "Player Dissatisfaction").  
3. **Selective Coding**: Identified the core category: **"Failure of Live-Service Integration."**  
- **Saturation**: Achieved after three iterative passes, with no new codes emerging in the final iteration.

## 3. Results  

### 3.1 Open Coding  
| **Code** | **Frequency** | **Examples** |  
|----------|---------------|-------------|  
| **Visual Datedness** | 8 | "visually dated," "low detail," "blurriness" |  
| **Combat Mediocrity** | 7 | "most average PlatinumGames combat," "repetitive slashing" |  
| **Microtransactions** | 6 | "over $150 in microtransactions," "cynical monetization" |  
| **Mission Structure** | 5 | "endless corridors," "tedious combat rooms" |  
| **Developer Reputation** | 4 | "PlatinumGames’ signature style absent" |  
| **Player Frustration** | 5 | "dreadfully short missions," "flow-breaking mechanics" |  

**Saturation Evidence**:** The code "Microtransactions" appeared in 6/8 paragraphs, indicating thematic dominance.

### 3.2 Axial Coding  

#### 3.2.1 Paradigm Model  
**Core Category**: *Failure of Live-Service Integration*  
- **Conditions**: High expectations from PlatinumGames’ reputation, $60 price tag.  
- **Context**: AAA live-service market saturation.  
- **Intervening Conditions**: Poor combat design, dated visuals.  
- **Consequences**: Player alienation, negative reviews, and financial risks for developers.

[Microtransactions] → [Perceived Exploitation]

### 3.3 Selective Coding  

#### 3.3.1 Theoretical Model  
**Core Category**: *Failure of Live-Service Integration*  
- **Mechanisms**:  
  - **Visual Datedness**: "The game’s art style, intended as an oil-painting aesthetic, instead created a 'sludgy, low-quality' player experience."  
  - **Combat Mediocrity**: "The combat lacks evolution, reducing engagement over time."  
  - **Microtransactions**: "The game’s $150+ premium store undermines its $60 price point."  
- **Outcome**: A disjointed, exploitative product that fails to align with player expectations.

## 4. Discussion  

### 4.1 Research Question 1: Live-Service Mechanics  
The review emphasizes that *Babylon’s Fall*’s Battle Passes and loot systems disrupt gameplay flow, contrasting with successful live-service titles like *Genshin Impact* (quoted as a "wake-up call" for publishers). The game’s "aggressive" monetization (e.g., mandatory hub returns after missions) alienates players, exacerbating by its full-price cost.  

### 4.2 Research Question 2: Gameplay Design  
Combat’s "average" execution (compared to *Bayonetta*) and mission structure flaws (e.g., "endless corridors") erode engagement. The "four-player scaling" flaw—enemies’ excessive health—creates tedious combat, even in co-op.  

### 4.3 Research Question 3: Developer Reputation  
PlatinumGames’ reputation for "excellent combat" (e.g., *NieR: Automata*) contrasts sharply with *Babylon’s Fall*’s "dull" systems, damaging trust in the studio’s direction.  

### 4.4 Theoretical Implications  
The study highlights risks of retrofitting live-service mechanics onto core gameplay, particularly when foundational design (e.g., combat, visuals) is subpar. This aligns with prior critiques of *Marvel’s Avengers*, cited in the review as a "disappointment."

## 5. Conclusion  

### 5.1 Key Findings  
- **Core Issue**: The game’s live-service framework undermines its AAA credentials through poor execution in visuals, combat, and mission design.  
- **Monetization Overreach**: Microtransactions and Battle Passes clash with its $60 price, alienating players.  
- **Developer Risk**: PlatinumGames’ reputation is strained by its shift toward live-service tropes.  

### 5.2 Limitations  
- **Single-Source Bias**: Analysis relies solely on one review; future studies should incorporate player surveys or additional critiques.  
- **Temporal Constraints**: Launch reviews may not reflect post-launch improvements.  

### 5.3 Future Directions  
- Longitudinal studies tracking *Babylon’s Fall*’s post-launch updates.  
- Comparative analysis of live-service titles (e.g., *Genshin Impact* vs. *Babylon’s Fall*).
