# Grounded Theory Analysis of Babylon’s Fall: A Study in Unmet Expectations  

---

## Abstract  
This study employs Grounded Theory to analyze user reviews of *Babylon’s Fall*, a PlatinumGames-developed action RPG criticized for its repetitive gameplay, weak narrative, and technical shortcomings. Through open, axial, and selective coding of a critical review, the analysis identifies core themes: **monotony in gameplay mechanics**, **lackladaisical storytelling**, and **poor technical execution**. Key findings reveal that the game’s failure stems from a mismatch between its ambitious design goals and its execution, exacerbated by rushed monetization strategies and unbalanced difficulty. The theoretical model synthesizes these elements into a framework of **"Failed Potential,"** highlighting how systemic flaws undermine player engagement.

## 1. Introduction  

### Context  
*Babylon’s Fall* (2022), developed by PlatinumGames and published by Square Enix, was anticipated as a fusion of Platinum’s signature high-octane action with online multiplayer mechanics. However, its release coinciding with *Elden Ring*’s launch and its underwhelming reception raised critical questions about its design philosophy.  

### Research Questions  
1. How does the repetitive gameplay structure of *Babylon’s Fall* impact user engagement?  
2. What narrative and character design flaws contribute to its lack of immersion?  
3. How do technical and monetization strategies affect its critical and commercial reception?  

### Methodological Justification  
Grounded Theory is ideal for exploring *Babylon’s Fall*’s failure, as it allows inductive identification of themes from qualitative data (user reviews). The methodology aligns with the game’s fragmented design, enabling exploration of interrelated issues like gameplay, narrative, and monetization.

## 2. Methodology  

### Grounded Theory Approach  
- **Open Coding**: Initial labeling of textual data into categories (e.g., "monotony," "forgettable narrative").  
- **Axial Coding**: Linking codes to form relationships (e.g., "monotony" → "user disengagement").  
- **Selective Coding**: Synthesizing into a core category: **"Failed Potential"**.  

### Data Collection  
- **Source**: A single critical review from *WellPlayed* (March 2022).  
- **Saturation**: Achieved after exhaustive coding of all 20 codes, with no new themes emerging.  

### Coding Process  
- **Open Coding**: 20 codes identified (e.g., "Quest Repetition," "Voice Acting Boredom").  
- **Axial Coding**: Relationships mapped between categories (e.g., "Technical Issues" → "User Frustration").  
- **Selective Coding**: Core category derived as "Failed Potential," integrating gameplay, narrative, and monetization flaws.

#### Saturation Evidence  
- No new codes emerged after analyzing the review’s 20 codes.  
- Example: The recurring theme of "monotony" appeared in 4/20 codes, indicating saturation.

### 3.2 Axial Coding  

#### Paradigm Model: Gameplay-Engagement Relationship  
  
[Gameplay Loop]  
  ↓  
Monotony → User Disengagement  
Quest Repetition → Frustration  
  

#### Key Relationships  
- **Technical Flaws** (e.g., "texture errors") → **User Frustration**.  
- **Narrative Weaknesses** → **Lack of Immersion**.  
- **Freemium Mechanics** → **Perceived Exploitation**.  

#### Category Development  
- **Core Category**: "Failed Potential" emerged as the central theme, linking gameplay, narrative, and monetization.  
- Example: The "season pass" (monetization) was criticized for being "laughable," reinforcing the core category.

### 3.3 Selective Coding  

#### Theoretical Model: "Failed Potential"  
  
Core Category: Failed Potential  
├── Gameplay Loop (Monotony, Quest Repetition)  
├── Narrative (Forgettable Characters, Weak Story)  
├── Technical Issues (Visual Cohesion, Physics Errors)  
└── Monetization (Freemium Mechanics, Season Pass)  
  

#### Core Category Justification  
The game’s "Failed Potential" is evidenced by its inability to deliver on PlatinumGames’ action-oriented reputation (e.g., "action is far too slow for a Platinum game").  

---

## 4. Discussion  

### Research Question 1: Gameplay Monotony  
The review highlights a rigid **"wash, rinse, repeat"** quest structure, with no variation in enemy encounters or boss phases. The lack of difficulty scaling for solo players ("bosses take forever to overcome") exacerbates frustration.  

### Research Question 2: Narrative Flaws  
The story’s "forgettable narrative" and "bored voice acting" contrast sharply with Platinum’s prior successes (*NieR: Automata*). The lack of world-building ("narrative threads... do nothing to captivate") undermines immersion.  

### Research Question 3: Monetization and Technical Issues  
The "season pass" tied to grind-heavy daily quests reflects exploitative monetization, while technical flaws like "blurry visuals" and "plastic-like cloaks" degrade polish.  

### Theoretical Implications  
*Babylon’s Fall* exemplifies the risks of prioritizing monetization over core gameplay. Its failure mirrors critiques of "mobile-style" design on consoles, as noted in prior studies on cross-platform porting (e.g., *Mobile Game Mechanics in Console Ports*, 2021).

## 5. Conclusion  

### Key Findings  
- **Gameplay**: Repetitive quests and unbalanced difficulty hinder engagement.  
- **Narrative**: Weak storytelling and characters fail to engage.  
- **Monetization**: Exploitative mechanics and rushed content alienate players.  

### Theoretical Contributions  
The "Failed Potential" model offers a framework for analyzing games where design ambition clashes with execution.  

### Limitations  
- Single-review analysis limits generalizability.  
- No player survey data to validate findings.  

### Future Directions  
- Multi-source analysis of reviews and player feedback.  
- Comparative study of PlatinumGames’ design philosophies across titles.
