## Abstract  
This study employs Grounded Theory to analyze critical reviews of *Babylon’s Fall*, PlatinumGames’ first live service title. The analysis identifies systemic design flaws, poor monetization strategies, and a misalignment of core gameplay mechanics as key factors in the game’s critical and commercial failure. Open coding revealed 20 core codes across categories like **Combat**, **Art Design**, and **Monetization**, with axial coding linking these to broader themes of **user dissatisfaction** and **live service mismanagement**. Selective coding identified the **core category** of **"Design and Monetization Failures Leading to User Dissatisfaction"**, explaining the game’s collapse. Findings highlight the risks of applying live service frameworks to action-oriented gameplay and the dangers of prioritizing microtransactions over player experience.

## 1. Introduction  

### 1.1 Research Questions  
1. **What user experience issues in *Babylon’s Fall* contributed to its negative reception?**  
2. **How did gameplay mechanics and design choices affect the game’s critical reception?**  
3. **What role did monetization strategies play in the game’s failure?**  

### 1.2 Context  
*Babylon’s Fall* (2022) marked PlatinumGames’ first live service title, combining Souls-like progression with third-person combat. Despite high expectations, it was critically panned for repetitive gameplay, poor visuals, and exploitative monetization. Grounded Theory was chosen to systematically identify systemic issues in player experience and design philosophy.

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 Grounded Theory Approach  
- **Open Coding**: Initial labeling of 20 codes from the review text (e.g., "Combat Variety," "Microtransactions").  
- **Axial Coding**: Linked codes to categories (e.g., *Combat* → *Gameplay Mechanics*).  
- **Selective Coding**: Identified core category: **"Design and Monetization Failures"**.  
- **Saturation**: No new codes emerged after analyzing the provided review and its 20 codes.  

### 2.2 Data Sources  
- Primary data: Metro News review (March 2022) and its coded analysis.  
- Secondary data: Industry context on Platinum’s prior work (e.g., *Bayonetta*, *NieR:Automata*).

## 3. Results  

### 3.1 Open Coding Results  
| **Category**          | **Sub-Categories**                          | **Frequency** | **Key Quotes**                                                                 |  
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Combat**             | Combat Variety, Engagement, Weapon System    | 5            | "Combat never evolves beyond initial state" (Metro, 2022). |  
| **Art Design**         | Visual Aesthetic, Consistency               | 4            | "Ugly, under-detailed graphics with clashing art styles" (Metro, 2022. |  
| **Monetization**        | Microtransactions, Pay-to-Win               | 5            | "Microtransactions for better gear" (Metro, 2022. |  
| **Gameplay Loop**      | Repetitiveness, Co-op Functionality         | 4            | "Repetitive arena-based progression" (Metro, 2022. |  
| **Technical Issues**    | Input Lag, Controls                          | 2            | "Jump input lag disrupts platforming" (Metro, 2022. |  

**Saturation Evidence**: 80% of codes clustered around **Combat**, **Art**, and **Monetization**, indicating thematic saturation.

### 3.2 Axial Coding: Paradigm Model  

**Core Categories and Relationships**  
  
[Core Category: Design and Monetization Failures]  
↓  
→ Gameplay Mechanics (Combat, Repetitiveness)  
→ Art Design (Visual Consistency)  
→ Monetization Strategies (Microtransactions)  
→ Technical Flaws (Input Lag)  
  

**Key Relationships**:  
- Poor **Combat Variety** → **Repetitiveness** → **User Engagement Drop**  
- **Clashing Art Styles** → **Aesthetic Dissonance** → **Player Dissatisfaction**  
- **Pay-to-Win Loot System** → **Perceived Exploitation** → **Negative Reception**

### 3.3 Selective Coding: Theoretical Model  

**Core Category Model**  
  
[Core Category: Design and Monetization Failures]  
├── Gameplay: Combat Stagnation (e.g., "dull and repetitive combat")  
├── Art: Visual Dissonance (e.g., "Renaissance filter on Mesopotamian setting")  
├── Monetization: Exploitative Loot System (e.g., "microtransactions for better gear")  
└── Technical: Input Lag (e.g., "jump input lag")  
  

**Theoretical Explanation**: The core category explains the game’s failure as a systemic breakdown across design, art, and monetization, exacerbated by technical flaws.  

---

## 4. Discussion  

### 4.1 User Experience Issues (RQ1)  
- **Technical Flaws**: Input lag and clunky controls disrupted core gameplay (e.g., "jump input lag").  
- **Aesthetic Dissonance**: The Renaissance filter clashed with the Mesopotamian setting, reducing immersion.  

### 4.2 Gameplay Mechanics (RQ2)  
- **Combat Stagnation**: Lack of progression in weapon systems ("combat never evolves") and tedious boss fights ("bosses with big health bars") alienated players.  
- **Co-op Dysfunction**: Inability to adjust loadouts mid-mission hindered teamwork.  

### 4.3 Monetization (RQ3)  
- **Exploitative Loot System**: Pay-to-win mechanics ("microtransactions for better gear") and a "terrible loot system" eroded trust.  
- **Price vs. Value**: £59.99 base price with exploitative DLC clashed with its "free-to-play" structure.  

---

## 5. Conclusion  

### 5.1 Key Findings  
- **Core Failure**: Misalignment between Platinum’s action expertise and live service design.  
- **Design Flaws**: Repetitive combat, clashing art, and exploitative monetization created a "worst live service title" (Metro, 2022).  
- **Theoretical Contribution**: Demonstrates risks of applying live service frameworks to action games without core gameplay innovation.  

### 5.2 Limitations  
- Single-review analysis limits generalizability.  
- No player survey data to validate critical claims.  

### 5.3 Future Work  
- Longitudinal studies on live service games’ monetization ethics.  
- Comparative analysis of Platinum’s prior action titles vs. *Babylon’s Fall*.
