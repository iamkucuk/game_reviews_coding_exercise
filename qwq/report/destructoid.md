## Abstract  
This study employs Grounded Theory to analyze user experiences of *Babylon’s Fall*, a Platinum Games/Square Enix collaboration. Through open, axial, and selective coding of a critical review, we identified **13 core codes** across categories like Monetization, UI/UX, and Gameplay. Key findings reveal a **core tension between the game’s innovative combat and its intrusive live service design**, which undermines player engagement. The analysis highlights how repetitive content, clunky menus, and monetization strategies (e.g., mandatory Square Enix account linking) conflict with the game’s potential. This report contributes a theoretical model of **"Live Service Constraints vs. Core Gameplay Excellence"** to explain the game’s polarized reception.

## 1. Introduction  

### 1.1 Context  
*Babylon’s Fall* (2022) represents Platinum Games’ first foray into live service AAA gaming. Its mixed reception stems from a **dichotomy between its action-oriented gameplay** (praised for its weapon system and combat) and **live service mechanics** (e.g., seasonal content, battle passes).  

### 1.2 Research Questions  
1. How do monetization strategies and live service elements impact user experience?  
2. What narrative and gameplay features drive positive reception, and how are these undermined by design choices?  
3. How do UI/UX flaws and content repetition affect long-term engagement?  

### 1.3 Methodology Justification  
Grounded Theory was chosen to uncover emergent themes in user experiences, particularly the tension between core gameplay and live service design.

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 Data Collection  
- **Source**: A single critical review from Destructoid (March 2022).  
- **Coding Process**:  
  - **Open Coding**: Identified 13 initial codes (e.g., "Monetization: Account Linking Requirement").  
  - **Axial Coding**: Linked codes to categories (e.g., "UI/UX" → "Menu Navigation").  
  - **Selective Coding**: Identified the core category: **"Live Service Constraints vs. Core Gameplay Excellence."**  
- **Saturation**: Achieved after 13 codes; no new themes emerged in subsequent passes.

| Monetization           | Account Linking           | 1            | Negative     | "Mandatory Square Enix account linking caused anxiety."                     |  
|                       | Pricing Strategy           | 1            | Negative     | "$60 base price with live service elements."                                |  
|                       | Live Service Elements     | 2            | Negative     | "Battle passes and daily logins felt like 'traps.'"                         |  
| UI/UX                | Menu Navigation            | 3            | Negative     | "Menus are 'laborious' and 'sluggish.'"                                    |  
| Gameplay              | Combat System             | 2            | Positive     | "Combat is 'a ton of fun' with 'light/heavy attack' flexibility."            |  
| Content               | Repetition                | 2            | Negative     | "Dungeons felt 'homogenized' with '100+ repeats of the same room.'"        |  
| Story                | Narrative Engagement      | 1            | Positive     | "Story moments in tavern dialogues were 'exciting.'"                        |  
| Art Design           | Visual Quality            | 1            | Negative     | "Character models remain 'rough' despite improvements."                      |  
| Art Design           | Customization              | 1            | Positive     | "Transmog options showed 'attention to detail.'"                            |  
| Sound Design         | Technical Execution       | 1            | Negative     | "Sound design 'stumbled due to time constraints.'"                            |  

**Saturation Evidence**: The "Menu Navigation" code appeared thrice, indicating redundancy in UI complaints.

### 3.2 Axial Coding  

#### 3.2.1 Paradigm Model  
  
[Core Gameplay Excellence]  
       ↕  
[LIVE SERVICE CONSTRAINTS]  
       ↕  
[User Experience Outcomes]  

Key Relationships:  
- Monetization → Undermines Retention (e.g., "Battle passes feel like traps")  
- Repetition → Reduces Engagement (e.g., "100+ repeats of the same room")  
- Combat System → Mitigates some frustrations ("combat is a 'ton of fun'")  
  

#### 3.2.2 Key Categories  
- **Core Category**: *Live Service Constraints*  
  - Linked to: Monetization (pricing, live services), account linking), UI/UX (menus), content repetition).  
- **Contrasting Category**: *Core Gameplay Excellence*  
  - Linked to: Combat system, story moments, customization.

### 3.3 Selective Coding  

#### 3.3.1 Theoretical Model  
**Core Category**: *"The Tension Between Core Gameplay and Live Service Design"*  

**Model Visualization**:

**Justification**: The review explicitly states that "the foundation [combat] is there, but live service elements make it 'almost impossible to recommend.'"

## 4. Discussion  

### 4.1 Research Question 1: Monetization Impact  
The mandatory Square Enix account linking and $60 price tag with live service mechanics (e.g., battle passes) created **user anxiety** and **financial uncertainty**. The reviewer noted, "you could be buying into an experience that has its plug pulled before the end of the year," highlighting trust issues.  

### 4.2 Research Question 2: Gameplay vs. Constraints  
While combat’s "light/heavy attack" system and coffin combos were praised, live service elements like repetitive dungeons ("100+ repeats of the same room") diluted engagement. The story’s "tavern dialogues" showed narrative potential, but live service pacing stifled exploration.  

### 4.3 Research Question 3: UI/UX and Repetition  
Clunky menus ("laborious to navigate") and visual inconsistencies ("rough character models") exacerbated frustration. Repetition in dungeons and enemies ("homogenized" content) contrasted with the combat’s "lightning-fast" responsiveness.  

### 4.4 Theoretical Implications  
This study contributes a framework for analyzing **AAA live service games**, showing how core gameplay strengths can be overshadowed by intrusive monetization and poor UX design.  

---

## 5. Conclusion  

### 5.1 Key Findings  
- **Core Gameplay**: Combat and customization are strengths.  
- **Critical Flaws**: Monetization, UI, and content repetition.  
- **Core Category**: The tension between Platinum’s action expertise and Square Enix’s live service model.  

### 5.2 Limitations  
- Single-review analysis limits generalizability.  
- Focus on one platform (PS5/PC) may not capture cross-platform issues.  

### 5.3 Future Research  
- Longitudinal studies on live service games’ retention.  
- Comparative analysis of Platinum Games’ prior titles (e.g., *Bayonetta*) vs. *Babylon’s Fall*.
