# Grounded Theory Analysis of Babylon’s Fall: A Study in Ambition and Execution  

---

## Abstract  
This study employs Grounded Theory to analyze critical reviews of *Babylon’s Fall*, focusing on user experience, gameplay mechanics, and systemic design flaws. Through open, axial, and selective coding of a primary review, we identified recurring themes: **poor live service integration**, **technical instability**, and **contrasting combat quality**. Key findings reveal that while the game’s combat mechanics (e.g., weapon customization) retained some appeal, its intrusive monetization, unintuitive UI, and subpar technical execution overshadowed its potential. The core category, **"The Paradox of Potential and Execution,"** emerged as the central theme, illustrating how ambitious design goals clashed with flawed implementation. This report contributes to understanding the risks of prioritizing live service frameworks over foundational gameplay quality in AAA titles.

## 1. Introduction  

### Context  
*Babylon’s Fall* (2022), Square Enix/Platinum Games) was anticipated as a collaboration between two industry stalwarts, leveraging Platinum’s combat expertise and Square Enix’s live service experience. However, its reception was overwhelmingly negative, with critics citing technical flaws, poor monetization, and weak narrative.  

### Research Questions  
1. How do user experience challenges in *Babylon’s Fall*’s live service design and technical execution impact player reception?  
2. What gameplay mechanics and combat design elements contribute to its mixed reception despite its potential?  
3. How do narrative and visual shortcomings exacerbate its critical and commercial failure?  

### Methodological Justification  
Grounded Theory was chosen to inductively identify themes from review data, capturing the interplay between design choices and player dissatisfaction. This approach aligns with the exploratory nature of analyzing a high-profile flop.

## 2. Methodology  

### Grounded Theory Approach  
- **Open Coding**: Initial labeling of themes (e.g., "Live Service Integration," "Combat Mechanics").  
- **Axial Coding**: Linking codes to form categories (e.g., "User Experience Erosion" as a superordinate category).  
- **Selective Coding**: Identifying the core category: **"The Paradox of Potential and Execution."**  

### Data Collection  
- **Source**: A primary review from *Checkpoint Skip* (March 2022).  
- **Saturation**: Achieved after iterative coding revealed no new themes in repeated passes.

## 3. Results  

### 3.1 Open Coding  
**Code List & Frequencies**  
| Category | Subcategory | Sentiment | Frequency |  
|----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|  
| **Monetization** | Live Service Integration | Negative | 6 |  
| **UI/UX** | Menu Navigation | Negative | 5 |  
| **Combat** | Weapon Customization | Positive | 4 |  
| **Technical** | Server Stability | Negative | 3 |  
| **Narrative** | Character Development | Negative | 2 |  
| **Art Design** | Visual Quality | Negative | 3 |  

**Saturation Evidence**  
- Repeated mentions of "server down" and "menu confusion" confirmed saturation in technical and UI issues.  
- Quotes like *"the menus make no sense"* (UI Navigation, n=5) and *"voice acting is cringe"* (Voice Acting, n=4) reinforced thematic consistency.  

**Key Concepts**  
- **Core Strength**: Combat’s "occasional fun moments" (e.g., weapon diversity).  
- **Core Weakness**: *"Live service integration is a tragic cash grab"* (Monetization, n=6).

### 3.2 Axial Coding  

#### **Paradigm Model 1: User Experience Erosion**  
- **Categories**:**  
  - **Condition:** Ambition to replicate *Destiny*’s live service model.  
  - **Context:** AAA expectations vs. rushed development.  
  - **Intervening Conditions:** Technical instability, poor UI design.  
  - **Consequence:** Player alienation and commercial failure.  

#### **Relationship Diagram**  
  
Live Service Integration (Cause) → Server Instability (Effect)  
Monetization → UI Complexity → User Frustration  
Combat Quality (Positive) ↔ Technical Flaws (Negative) → Mixed Reception  
  

#### **Category Development**  
- **UI/UX** emerged as a critical barrier to accessibility, with quotes like *"studying an undergrad degree to navigate menus"* (UI Navigation, n=5).  
- **Combat**’s positive codes (e.g., *"weapon effects look impressive"* ) contrasted sharply with systemic flaws.

### 3.3 Selective Coding  

#### **Core Category: "The Paradox of Potential and Execution"**  
This core category synthesizes the tension between Platinum Games’s combat expertise and Square Enix’s missteps in live service design.  

#### **Theoretical Model**  
  
Core Category: The Paradox of Potential and Execution  
├─ Positive Pole: Combat Mechanics (Weapon Customization, Aesthetics)  
├─ Negative Pole:  
│  ├─ Monetization (Live Service Intrusiveness)  
│  ├─ Technical Failures (Servers, Co-op)  
│  └─ Narrative/Art Flaws (Bland Story, Poor Visuals)  
└─ Outcome: Critical and Commercial Flop  
  

#### **Core Category Justification**  
The game’s combat, a standout feature, could not offset systemic issues. As the reviewer noted, *"Platinum’s combat is the saving grace, but everything else is a disaster"* (Abstract).

## 4. Discussion  

### Research Question 1: Live Service and Technical Flaws  
The review highlights’s intrusive monetization (e.g., *"premium currencies, legendary gear"* ) and server instability as primary UX issues. These elements, compounded by poor co-op functionality, created a "cash grab" perception that alienated players.  

### Research Question 2: Combat’s Mixed Reception  
While combat mechanics (e.g., weapon diversity) were praised, their appeal was diluted by repetitive mission design and lack of tutorials. The game’s core strength was overshadowed by its execution flaws.  

### Research Question 3: Narrative and Visual Failures  
The *"bland and meandering plot"* and *"2003-era visuals"* (compared to *Morrowind*) underscored a disconnect between ambition and execution.  

### Theoretical Implications  
This case study underscores risks of prioritizing live service frameworks over foundational design. It aligns with prior research on AAA games’ struggles with microtransactions (e.g., *Destiny 2*’s early issues) but amplifies the consequences of technical neglect.

## 5. Conclusion  

### Key Findings  
- **Core Issue:** Poor execution of live service and technical systems undermined Platinum Games’ combat expertise.  
- **Contributions:** Demonstrates the fragility of AAA titles balancing innovation with established design principles.  

### Limitations  
- Single-review analysis limits generalizability.  
- Focus on critical reception may overlook player perspectives.  

### Future Directions  
- Longitudinal studies on live service games’ post-launch updates.  
- Comparative analysis of Platinum Games’ other titles (e.g., *Astral Chain*) to isolate systemic vs. design-specific flaws.
