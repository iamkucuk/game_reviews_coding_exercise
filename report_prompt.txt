# Grounded Theory Research Report Generation

You are writing a formal academic research report based on your Grounded Theory analysis of Babylon's Fall game reviews. Your task is to synthesize your coding results into a comprehensive report following ACM CHI format.

## Report Development Process

### Step 1: Formulate Research Questions

Based on your coding analysis, develop 2-3 specific research questions that address:

- User experience patterns in Babylon's Fall
- Critical aspects of gameplay that affected reception
- Any other significant themes that emerged during analysis

### Step 2: Create Report Structure

Develop a complete report with the following sections:

1. Abstract (150 words)
    - Summarize methodology, approach, and key findings
2. Introduction
    - Context of Babylon's Fall
    - Research questions
    - Justification for analyzing game reviews through GT methodology
3. Methodology
    - Grounded Theory approach explanation
    - Data collection details (review sources)
    - Coding process description (open, axial, selective)
    - Saturation determination method
4. Results
a. Open Coding
    - Comprehensive code list with frequencies
    - Saturation evidence with examples
    - Key concepts identified with supporting quotes
    
    b. Axial Coding
    
    - Paradigm models for major categories
    - Relationship diagrams showing connections
    - Category development with examples
    
    c. Selective Coding
    
    - Theoretical model visualization
    - Core category justification
    - Integration of categories with supporting evidence
5. Discussion
    - Address each research question with evidence
    - Theoretical implications of findings
    - Comparison with existing literature if applicable
6. Conclusion
    - Summary of key findings
    - Theoretical contributions
    - Limitations
    - Future research directions

## Academic Writing Guidelines

- Use formal academic language
- Maintain objective analytical tone
- Support claims with direct evidence from reviews
- Follow ACM CHI format
- Use diagrams to represent theoretical models
- Include sufficient quotes to demonstrate grounding in data
